Starting as a developer would be an obvious choice for me to start my career with. One might say. However, developing is just one aspect. Another cool aspect is to have to design stuff. Unfortunately, that’s not the job a developer is expected to do.\n' +

As a Test Automation Engineer I like to have both jobs: solving the big issues and designing and building the perfect solution for it.'
